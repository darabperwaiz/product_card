# Responsive Product Cards with React and Tailwind CSS

This project demonstrates how to create responsive product cards using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The product cards are dynamically rendered based on a data array and showcase a minimalist, modern design. The layout is fully responsive and adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Cards**:
  - Product data is stored in an array and rendered dynamically using `.map()`.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Tailwind CSS utilities (`grid`, `sm:`, `lg:`) are used to create a responsive grid layout.
- **Minimalist Styling**:
  - Clean, modern design using Tailwind's utility classes.
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Includes a `Buy Now` button with hover and focus effects.
- **Sample Products**:
  - 6 products with placeholders for image, title, description, and price.

    id: 1,
    title: "Minimalist Chair",
    description: "A sleek and stylish chair for modern interiors.",
    price: "$149.99",
    image: "https://via.placeholder.com/400x250",
  },
  ...
];
```
